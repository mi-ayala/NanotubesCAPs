## Abstract
We present a framework based on computer-assisted proofs that turns standard
geometry optimization simulations for atomistic structures into mathematical
proofs. Starting from a
numerically computed approximation of a local minimizer or saddle point, we use
validated numerical computations to prove the existence of a critical point of
the potential energy close to this approximation. We demonstrate this framework in two settings. In the first, we
study capped carbon nanotubes modeled as minimizers of carbon interatomic
potentials (harmonic, Tersoff, and a Huber potential) and obtain proven
bounds on tube diameter, bond lengths, and bond angles. In particular, we show
that caps induce diameter oscillations along the tube. As a second
application, we consider a finite Lennard--Jones crystal in a face-centered
cubic (fcc) lattice and provide computer-
proofs of a local minimizer
representing the perfect crystal, a local minimizer with a single vacancy
defect, and a saddle point that connects two single-vacancy configurations on
the energy landscape.
